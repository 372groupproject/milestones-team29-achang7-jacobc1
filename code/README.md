# Affine Cipher 
File: p3_program.groovy

Implements an affine cipher. Prompts the user for a message to be encrypted. 
Affine ciphers use the equation ax + b = X, where x is the plaintext and X is the ciphertext.
The programs prompts the user for their key values, a and b, and checks that the key is "viable"
(i.e gcd(a,26) = 1), using the Euclidean algorithm.
The passed in message is then encrypted with this key and printed.

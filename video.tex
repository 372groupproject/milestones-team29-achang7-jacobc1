\begin{itemize}
    \item The theme of the video is to point out the advantages of Groovy and the basic concepts in Groovy
    \item Since Groovy is very similar to Java, but is an easy language to learn like python, our group would like to point out how Groovy incorporates the popular language into one
    \item Code sample: connect4 and maybe another feature program
    \item We are going to record a video of our screen while running the program on the terminal. 
    \item Our group would meet on zoom and give the presentation

For our project we will be implementing a game. Our program will be object
oriented, focusing on the main Java aspects of Groovy, while also using 
portions of Groovy including closure statements.
The project should span a couple of class files and should be a a couple 
hundred lines of code. Approximately 400 - 500.
This will be a good demonstration of our programming language because Groovy is
made to be run in the same environment (in place of) Java. However, Groovy 
is supposed to allow for more flexibility than Java allows. Groovy is very 
much an Object oriented language, and Game development can show very well how
the language is written and what it is capable of.
